# Device Sensors Workshop

The main goals of this workshop is to let you deal with more challenges of mobile devices capabilities and become familiar with as many of them as possible.

## Start Here
You should create an *RN* app using `react-native init rnWorkshop` (or call it whatever you want).<br>
The app will have 4 screens, in each screen there will be different implementation of a workshop task.

You are free to design your application the way your see fit. You are the owner, the designer and the poor developer to implement it all 😬

### Task 1: Geo-Location
Build an interface to show the exact geographic location of your device (longitude, latitude).<br>
You may use the following:
[React Native Geolocation API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation)

Bonus: show it on a map!

### Task 2: Gestures
Build an interface where the user will use the following touches:
* drag/pan
* swipe
* long press

You may use the following:
[React Native Handling-Touches](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/handling-touches),
[React Native Gesture Responder System](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system)

### Task 3: Gyroscope
Build an interface that reflects the device's gyroscope values.<br>
You may use the following:
[React Native Sensors](https://react-native-sensors.github.io/)

Bonus: build a gyro ball (like in an airplane cockpit)

### Task 4: Accelerometer
Build an interface that reflects the device's accelerometer values.<br>
You may use the following:
[React Native Sensors](https://react-native-sensors.github.io/)

Bonus: build 3-axes graph with the 3 directions values
